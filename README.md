# Placement_ML_Project

## Placement end-to-end Machine Learning / Data Science Project

### Description

In this mini project I used a toy dataset (placement.csv) with just 2 features i.e ``cgpa`` and ``iq`` of the student. The label was whether the student was able to secure the ``placement`` or not.

### Process

- Data transformation was done using the `pandas` library.
- Used `matplotlib` to analyze the data with the help of a scatterplot.
- Executed the train test split and scaled the data accordingly.
- Training the data was done using `LinearRegression`.
- Model accuracy was tested and the final model was dumped into a `.pkl` file which can be used in a wesite/application.
